# springboard_naive_bayes

This is my mini project from springboard for naive bayes classifiers. This notebook includes several exercises relating to a rotten tomatoes movie review dataset classified as 'fresh' or 'rotten' movies based on the word choice and combinations of words. The best performing model is the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using 4-grams and document frequencies.
